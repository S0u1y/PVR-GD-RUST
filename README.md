# Programming in Rust Project Game

This is a project game inspired by stalker universe with mechanics like soulash - top-down "tactical" (hardcore?) survival sandbox

The idea is to have a hard post-nuclear world for the player to survive in, with anomalies that spew out special artefacts which give special effects to the player,
the world should be sandbox - meaning the player will be able to build their own bases and craft items like tools, guns, furniture, etc.

Radiation will be ever-present, with some areas having a deeper and stronger pocket of radiation inside of it. The player will at all times need to use a gasmask and have filters that they will have to change out every now and then and if they want to venture further into more dangerous (but also more high-loot bearing) locations, they'll have to upgrade their masks and filters.

## State of development

Currently the game is in heavy WIP. Below are the baseline features of it.

- [ ] World with entities etc
  - [x] Entity list
  - [ ] Faster entities act before slower ones

- [x] Movement based on A* or other algorithm
  - [ ] Show path to mouse position 
    
- [ ] Enemy/mob AI

- [ ] Hunger, thirst and radiation + their effects

- [ ] Basic anomalies
